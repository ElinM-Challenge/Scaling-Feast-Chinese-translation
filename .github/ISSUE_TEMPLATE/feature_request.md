**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
(If so, replace this with a clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]. If not, remove this section.)

**Describe the feature you'd like**
(If your feature request is related to a problem, replace this with a clear and concise solution to the problem. Otherwise, replace this with a clear and concise description of the feature you'd like. Include all relevant details.)

**Describe why this feature belongs in Scaling Feast**
(Replace this with an explanation as to why your feature belongs in Scaling Feast. This differs from the description of the feature. The description describes the feature, this explanation explains why this feature should be added. If applicable, explain why Scaling Feast should implement this feature, and not another mod [include the names of the other mods if this is the case].)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(Replace this with a clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. This may include a list of other mods you've installed to get the desired result, along with why they didn't work, and a brief description of CraftTweaker scripts you've written that failed to get the result you wanted [please do NOT paste entire CraftTweaker scripts here].)

**Additional context**
(Replace this with any other context or screenshots about the feature request.)
